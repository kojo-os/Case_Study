In this file, I will upload my research for the case study.

I was first introduced to what a hash is. A hash was described as essentially a digital fingerprint for any digital data. It is basically a very long number which is generated for any data by some hidden algorithm by a computer. Next, I was introduced to what a block is, and in turnn what a blockchain is. A blockchain is made up of a sequential collection of blocks, each with different data (block number, nonce, data) that it uses to compute a specific hash. The hash of each block is very important as it determines if a block will be considered valid in the blockchain based on the data it contains. In other words, a blockchain will have a preset rule for what is considered a valid hash of any blocks. This rule simply describes the nature of the hash that a block must have in order to be accepted by the blockchain system. For instance, Bitcoin blockchains accept hashes that are made up of 17 zeroes, and this rule is updated after every 2000 blocks or so. This raises the question of how a computer can identify which nonce generates the right hash, and this is referred to as 'mining'.

Mining refers to the use of computer algorithms to determine a nonce for a block in a blockchain which allows the block to obtain a valid hash (be validated in the blockchain). The specific algorithm used by the computer is very complicated and disallows for the obtaining of the nonce from any given hash. This makes this system quite immune to tampering.

Most blockchain based-currencies have no real central authority or management overlooking the process of transaction. They work based on distributed blockchain systems, in which many people possess an individual copy of the blockchain and attempt to mine for the nonce of new blocks added to the blockchain. After they all obtain an answer, the system will poll their results and select the most occuring nonce (and hash) as the one to use in the official blockchain. This ensures that for tampering to occur, one has to purchase off at least 51% of the distributed blockchains, which is extremely hard to do since the blockchains are disributed to a large multitude of computers.
